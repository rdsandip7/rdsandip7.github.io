										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/supplychain.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p><h3> Supply Chain Analysis Project</br></h3>
										 I'm excited to share with you a recent project that I've completed â€“ a supply chain analysis project that explores key insights into the world of logistics and product management. This project delves into various aspects of supply chain management, including revenue analysis, product type sales, transportation cost analysis, defect rate examination, and more. I'm thrilled to provide you with a glimpse of this project's key highlights.
										</br>
									       <h3>Project Overview</br></h3>										
										In today's fast-paced business landscape, efficient supply chain management is more critical than ever. This project aims to shed light on the intricate details of supply chain operations for a Fashion and Beauty startup. Here's a brief overview of what I've explored in this analysis:</br>
										
								               <h3>Revenue Generation by Product Type</br>	</h3>								
										I examined how product types, particularly skincare, haircare, and cosmetics, impact revenue generation. The findings revealed that skincare products play a pivotal role in revenue, with higher-priced skincare items contributing significantly to the bottom line.</br>
										
										<h3> Sales by Product Type</br>	</h3>									
										The project provides insights into sales by product type, allowing us to identify which product categories drive the majority of business.</br>
										
										<h3> Transportation Cost Analysis</br>	</h3>									
										Analyzing shipping costs by different carriers, we discovered how carrier choices can influence the bottom line. A particular emphasis was placed on Carrier B, which proved instrumental in generating higher revenue.</br>
										
										<h3> Inventory and Defect Rate</br>	</h3>									
										We examined stock levels for each SKU to assess inventory management. Additionally, the project delves into the average defect rate for all product types, highlighting the importance of maintaining product quality.</br>
										
									        <h3> Key Findings	</br>		</h3>							
										The project generated valuable insights, including the identification of top-performing SKUs, the discovery of revenue drivers, and the evaluation of transportation modes' defect rates. These findings can guide decision-making, enabling businesses to optimize their supply chain operations and boost profitability.</br>
										
								                <h3>Recommendations</br></h3>										
										Based on the analysis, I've developed recommendations to enhance supply chain efficiency. These recommendations encompass strategies to reduce costs, improve quality control, optimize inventory levels, and choose the right transportation modes.</br>
										
								               <h3>Conclusion</br>	</h3>									
										Effective supply chain analysis can provide businesses with a competitive edge in today's dynamic market. This project demonstrates the importance of data-driven decision-making and the potential for enhancing supply chain efficiency to drive success.</br>
										
										Feel free to explore the detailed analysis and findings presented in this project. I'm always eager to discuss how data-driven solutions can drive your business forward.										
										Thank you for visiting my portfolio and considering my work. If you have any questions or would like to discuss collaboration opportunities, please don't hesitate to <a href="#footer">Contact me</a>!

									<h2>Air Quality Data Analysis</h2>    
    									<p>I'm excited to share one of my recent data analysis projects: the Air Quality Data Analysis. In this project, I delved into a dataset related to air quality, with the goal of understanding the factors that influence air quality and their impact on the environment.</p>
									<h3>Project Overview</h3>

									    <p><strong>Data Source:</strong> I worked with a comprehensive dataset containing various attributes, including industrial activity, proximity to natural reserves, pollution levels (PM10 and PM2.5), traffic density, distance to the coast, humidity, and more.</p>
									
									    <h3>Key Insights and Visualizations</h3>
									
									    <ol>
									        <li>
									            <p><strong>Industrial Activity and Proximity to Natural Reserves:</strong> To investigate the relationship between industrial activity and proximity to natural reserves, I created a contingency table and performed a chi-squared test to determine whether the two variables are dependent.</p>
									        </li>
									        <li>
									            <p><strong>Mean PM10 Levels:</strong> I compared mean PM10 levels in regions with high industrial activity (industrial codes 4 and 5) and low industrial activity (industrial codes 1 and 2). The analysis revealed significant differences between the two groups.</p>
									        </li>
									        <li>
									            <p><strong>Difference in Mean PM2.5 Levels:</strong> I conducted a two-sample t-test to compare mean PM2.5 levels between regions with high traffic density and low traffic density. The results provided insights into the impact of traffic on air quality.</p>
									        </li>
									        <li>
									            <p><strong>Mean Population in Inland Regions:</strong> I analyzed the mean population in inland regions by Australian state and performed a one-way ANOVA to test for significant differences among states.</p>
									        </li>
									        <li>
									            <p><strong>AQI vs. PM2.5:</strong> Using a scatter plot and linear regression, I explored the relationship between Air Quality Index (AQI) and PM2.5 levels, providing a predictive model and a prediction interval for AQI.</p>
									        </li>
									    </ol>
									
									    <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
									
									    <ul>
									        <li>Python for data analysis</li>
									        <li>Pandas for data manipulation</li>
									        <li>Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization</li>
									        <li>Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization</li>
									    </ul>
									
									    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
									
									    <p>The Air Quality Data Analysis project highlights the significance of data-driven insights in understanding environmental factors affecting air quality. By employing statistical tests, visualizations, and regression models, I gained valuable insights into the data, which can inform environmental policies and decision-making.</p>
